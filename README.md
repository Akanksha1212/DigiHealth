# DigiHealth
A Mobile Application solution to digitize the process of storing the medical history of the patient via a unique id wherein reports, prescriptions can be added & viewed by both Doctor and Patient..

## What it does?  
These days patients have to maintain and carry many reports, prescriptions, etc to keep track of their medical history which can be very useful in providing them the right treatment but it's not easy to do so especially for people who have severe diseases. So we build a mobile application DigiHealth a patient can use to save all their medical reports and prescriptions, book appointments, and can visit any hospital in India and they do not need to carry all their previous reports.
A unique code (in form of QR code) will be provided to all the users/patients that can be used at hospitals and at medical stores. Chemists can scan this QR code and get the digital prescription. Doctors also don't need paper for writing prescriptions. They can feed the data for that patient via this mobile app. And the patient can view his reports and prescriptions anytime and anywhere.
